The team has been hired from a eCommerce store and is required to perform an analysis of the costumer behavior.
The task was challenging, but extremely interesting. We had to analyse the actions that a user does in the store and highlight meaningful patterns in the data.

The repository consists of the following files:

1. **ADM_HW2_main.ipynb** :
> A Jupyter notebook which provides the solution to the research questions we were provided.

```
Research Question:

- [RQ1] Which is the rate of complete funnels?
- [RQ2] What are the categories of the most trending products overall?
- [RQ3] For each category, what's the brand whose prices are higher on average?
- [RQ4] How much does each brand earn per month?
- [RQ5] In what part of the day is your store most visited?
- [RQ6] What's the conversion rate of your online store?
- [RQ7] Prove that the Pareto principle applies to your store.

Note that this are the "main" RQs, but if you are interested in finding out
many other informations about the eCommerce store just open the notebook!

```

2. **functions.py**
> A py file which provides the functions used in the ```ADM_HW2_main.ipynb``` notebook.
