# Homework 4 - Hard coding

**Goal of the homework**: write important algorithms and functions from scratch.

## Tasks at hand
In this fourth homework we have worked on three distinct topics:
1. Build a Hash function and HyperLogLog algorithm from scratch
2. Build KMeans' clustering algorithm from scratch by applying it to the [Amazon foods dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)
3. Algorithmic question to prove the Running Time of a given function

## Description of the Repository
The repository contains:

1. A Jupyter Notebook "main.ipynb" file containing for each point of the homework the explanation of what has been done and the relative outputs
2. A python file named as "functions.py" containing all the functions explained that we used in our homework
