# ADM-HW5
This repository contains all the code and explanations for Homework 5 of Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining class. In this assignment we analyze the Wikipedia's articles network by applying graph algorithms.

## Data and Setting
There are many options to collect and build the Wikipedia's underlying network, we rely on the dataset provided [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QVt0aMOFvLjOEm5eKeCxBQUwIU30_NIh/view).

Note that in the reduced version of the network we removed the categories whose number of articles in less than 5000 and more than 30000.
